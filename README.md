## TLDR ðŸ‘€

A portfolio of mine, created to imitate the mock-up from Coding Bootcamp week 2's challenge. Used **HTML** and **CSS** only. Spent most time on CSS. This has helped me broaden my knowledge on *spacing, box model, spacing, flex box, text+image+color styling and mobile responsive*. A good practice for my first project built from scratch.

## Challenges ðŸ¤”

* It was a struggle to decide which units should be applied for which property, so I decided to pause and read up on a bunch of documents. The article from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-rem-vs-em-units) was the most helpful one.
* Spacing like padding, border, and margin, then account them for either border-box or content-box. Also added flex box on top of them. Some how it works but I feel there's a lot more I need to research on.

A lot more challenges were encountered but the two above are the major ones. If you were struggling with them before and have resources that helped you in the past, then please point me to them.

## Usage

* Users can view the portfolio on differents devices like a desktop, tablet or mobile phone.
