## TLDR ðŸ‘€

A portfolio of mine, created to imitate the mock-up from Coding Bootcamp week 2's challenge. Use **HTML** and **CSS** only. Spend most time on CSS. This have helped me broaden my knowledge on *spacing, box model, spacing, flex box, text+image+color styling and mobile responsive*. A good practice for my first project build from scratch.

## Challenges ðŸ¤”

* I was a struggle to decide which unit should be apply for which property, so I decided to pause and read up a bunch of document. An article from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-rem-vs-em-units) was the most helpful one.
* Spacing like padding, border, and margin, then account them for either border-box or content-box. Then, add flex box on top of that, some how it works but I feel there's a lot more I need to research on.

A lot more challenges were encountered but the two above are the major ones. If you know what I'm talking about and have resources that help you in the past with these, then please point me to them.

## Usage
